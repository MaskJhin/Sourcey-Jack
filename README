Sourcey Jack - A simple SOCKSifying application for Windows

(c) 2011 James Forshaw

This is a simple application to inject into a process and add basic SOCKSv4 support to it.

It uses a modified version of EasyHook (http://easyhook.codeplex.com/) which removes the requirement to
run it as admin or to add files to the GAC (which seems a somewhat silly thing to do). The modified source
is provided in the repository.
